These smart devices are transforming how we grow — turning real-time climate data into smarter agricultural decisions.\n\nEach station collects and analyzes:\n\n🌡️ Hyper-local 7-day forecasts\n🌿 Leaf moisture, soil humidity, daily temperature  \n💧 Dew point, rainfall, and relative humidity\n🛡️ Early warnings for coffee-specific diseases\n\nWhy are we doing this?\n\nBecause modern agriculture isn't guesswork — it's precision. And because we believe that trust is built on transparency. Our goal is to ensure that our investors and partners can see the care and science behind every tree.\n\nFrom now on, weather-related risks will be seen before they become problems. That means:\n\n✅ Higher yields\n✅ Smarter interventions  \n✅ A resilient future for every tree we plant\n\nWe're not just growing coffee.\n\nWe're connecting agriculture to the future — one smart station at a time. 🌍",
