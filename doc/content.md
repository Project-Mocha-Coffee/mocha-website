Section Title:
Our Story
Content:
Project Mocha was founded in 2024 with a vision to connect investors with the world’s most cherished crop—coffee—while supporting ethical, sustainable farming. What began as a small pilot in the Embu, Kenya is growing into a global initiative that empowers communities and delivers real returns.


Our journey begins with bringing 2000 coffee trees from our pilot farm in Embu. After the first year, we plan to increase the number of coffee trees to 200 million by 2040 introduce innovative agroforestry techniques, and partner with over investors worldwide. Our mission is to make coffee farming accessible, profitable, and sustainable—benefiting both our investors and the communities who grow the beans.

We pay our farmers above market rates, invest in research around the monetisation of biodiversity data, IoT sensors for farm management and invest in water conservation projects to ensure long-term environmental health.
